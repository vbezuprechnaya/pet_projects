All that I've ever done in my life

## The coolest part is web

### Tetris game 
![actual frame](https://github.com/vbezuprechnaya/pet_projects/blob/main/web_projects/tetris/references/land.jpg?raw=true)
The idea was to create a game with nice UI and original theme. I've decided to decorate all tetrominos(figures) as colored blocks of typical building of the Soviet period. I think it's quite stylish. The design you can find on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sltQimsk1c9qxaxOBQkn0y/tetris?node-id=0%3A1&t=90NUczCd5b9dQ9ia-1). Code and all you need is in *web_projects/tetris* directory.

### E-Library
The task was to make web app for home library based on express using pug(ex Jade). Main elements were book grid and book page/card, where you can edit information about book, delete it, lend it to someone or return it. The prototype you checkout on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FO1kda9TtQlZiGtYaItm0my%2FLibrary%3Fnode-id%3D88%253A104%26t%3D90NUczCd5b9dQ9ia-1"). 

I think that the result is much better. By chance take a look at it.

### Social media app on Angular && Administration module using JQuery

In progress... wait for it

### JS Game 


## Course works
There are two different works.


  The first one is about BMP. All functions with images in BMP format are implemented, namely: drawing a circle, copying an area, reflecting an area. Everything is presented to the end user in the form of an application with a command-line interface. The Getopt framework was used to write the CLI. The development was carried out in the C language. As a result, an application was developed that prompts the user for a BMP file.
  
  The second one is about creating and analyzing data structures. This course work demonstrates a realization of two different data structures: an AVL-Tree and a Hash table with open addressing in order to solve the problem of collision during the next theoretical research. Operations in both data structures are search, insertion and deletion of any element from output data. Moreover, the program draws flow charts, which show the dependency between time and the amount of input data.
	
## Modeling of physical process
 There are 2 of them again:
 ### Iceberg
 In this project you can see the use of OpenGL for drawing the falling of an iceberg and its drowning. Moreover, in order to approximate calculations was used Runge Kutta 4th order. All the files you'll find in the Iceberg folder.
 ### SIR 
 The work includes solvation for direct and inverse problems for the SIR model. Everything is in the Bio directory, even a note with used articles and weird calculations. The SEIR one is gonna be fixed a little bit later. Right now there is only direct problem solution.
